# eapquickstarts

This project is a demonstration of the dependencies that might needed to be added 
while working on certain components in EAP camel .

camel-soap : Requires modification of the module.xml to add javax.jws.api package

CXF interceptors need a few packages to be added.

The ultimate goal is to create a few projects which can be templated for use in regular
projects for camel startup in EAP.
